# TPCH Query 5 Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the approach, design decisions, optimizations, and challenges encountered during the implementation of TPCH Query 5 using multithreading in C++.

## Approach

### Data Model

The implementation uses custom data structures to represent the TPCH schema tables:

- **Customer**: Contains customer information including customer key and nation key
- **Orders**: Contains order information including order key, customer key, and order date
- **LineItem**: Contains line item details including order key, supplier key, extended price, and discount
- **Supplier**: Contains supplier information including supplier key and nation key
- **Nation**: Contains nation information including nation key, name, and region key
- **Region**: Contains region information including region key and name

### Query Execution Strategy

The query execution follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Read data from TPCH files into memory-efficient structures
2. **Filtering**: Apply date range and region filters early to reduce the dataset
3. **Join Processing**: Perform the necessary joins between tables
4. **Aggregation**: Group by nation name and calculate revenue
5. **Sorting**: Sort results by revenue in descending order

### Multithreading Approach

The implementation uses a thread pool to parallelize processing:

1. **Data Partitioning**: Divide the data into chunks for parallel processing
2. **Task Distribution**: Assign chunks to worker threads
3. **Synchronization**: Use atomic operations and locks to ensure thread safety during aggregation
4. **Result Merging**: Combine partial results from each thread

## Optimizations

### Memory Efficiency

- Use of compact data structures to minimize memory footprint
- Lazy loading of data when possible
- Early filtering to reduce working set size

### Performance Optimizations

- Custom hash join implementation for efficient table joins
- Minimizing string operations by using string views and integer keys
- Vectorization for numerical calculations where applicable
- Cache-friendly data layouts

### Thread Management

- Dynamic work stealing to balance load across threads
- Minimizing thread synchronization overhead
- Batch processing to reduce contention

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Efficient Joins

**Problem**: Joining multiple large tables efficiently without a database engine.

**Solution**: Implemented a custom hash join algorithm that builds hash tables for smaller tables and probes with larger tables. This reduces the computational complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

### Challenge 2: Memory Management

**Problem**: Processing large datasets without excessive memory usage.

**Solution**: Used streaming techniques where possible, processed data in chunks, and implemented early filtering to reduce memory requirements.

### Challenge 3: Thread Synchronization

**Problem**: Ensuring thread safety during aggregation without excessive locking.

**Solution**: Used fine-grained locking and lock-free data structures where possible. Implemented a two-phase aggregation where threads first build local results and then merge them.

## Performance Analysis

Performance tests were conducted with varying thread counts and data sizes. Key findings:

- Linear scaling observed up to the number of physical CPU cores
- Diminishing returns when thread count exceeds available cores
- Memory bandwidth becomes the bottleneck with very large datasets

## Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated partitioning strategies
- Add support for compressed data formats
- Explore SIMD optimizations for numerical calculations
- Implement a query planner for more complex queries
